## 6. Temporal Query Requirements

### 6.1 Overview

Support historical queries about facts, relationships, and attributes at specific points in time.

**Example Queries:**
- "Who did I work with at Acme Corp in 1996?"
- "What was my home phone number in 2004?"
- "Where did we live when Emma was born?"
- "What was Sarah's job title before she got promoted?"
- "List all the addresses I've lived at"

### 6.2 Temporal Data Model

All facts and attributes support temporal validity ranges (bitemporal where needed).

| Req ID | Requirement | Priority |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| TEMP-001 | Store valid_from and valid_to timestamps on facts | High |
| TEMP-002 | Support open-ended ranges (valid_to = NULL means current) | High |
| TEMP-003 | Use PostgreSQL TSTZRANGE for efficient range queries | High |
| TEMP-004 | Create GiST index on temporal ranges | High |
| TEMP-005 | Support "as of" queries (point-in-time lookups) | High |
| TEMP-006 | Track when facts were recorded vs when they were true (bitemporal) | Medium |

#### Temporal Schema Pattern
```sql
facts:
├── content
├── valid_from TIMESTAMPTZ      -- When fact became true
├── valid_to TIMESTAMPTZ        -- When fact stopped being true (NULL = current)
├── valid_range TSTZRANGE       -- Computed range for indexing
├── recorded_at TIMESTAMPTZ     -- When we learned this fact
└── superseded_by UUID          -- Link to newer version of same fact

-- Example: Job history
-- "I worked at Acme Corp from 1995-1998"
valid_from: 1995-01-01, valid_to: 1998-06-30

-- "My phone number was 555-1234" (until changed)
valid_from: 2004-03-15, valid_to: 2010-08-01
```

### 6.3 Temporal Query Types

| Req ID | Query Type | SQL Pattern | Example |
|--------|------------|-------------|---------|
| TEMP-Q-001 | Point-in-time | `WHERE valid_range @> '1996-06-01'::timestamptz` | "Coworkers in 1996" |
| TEMP-Q-002 | Range overlap | `WHERE valid_range && '[1995,2000)'` | "Jobs in the late 90s" |
| TEMP-Q-003 | Current state | `WHERE valid_to IS NULL` | "Current phone number" |
| TEMP-Q-004 | History list | `ORDER BY valid_from` | "All addresses I've lived at" |
| TEMP-Q-005 | Timeline | Aggregate by period | "Career timeline" |

### 6.4 Temporal Relationship Tracking

Relationships also have temporal validity:

| Req ID | Requirement | Priority |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| TEMP-REL-001 | Track when relationships started and ended | High |
| TEMP-REL-002 | Support "worked with" queries at specific times | High |
| TEMP-REL-003 | Track role/title changes within relationships | Medium |

#### Example: Employment History
```sql
relationships:
├── source_entity_id (you)
├── target_entity_id (Acme Corp)
├── relationship_type (WORKED_AT)
├── attributes JSONB ({"title": "Engineer", "department": "R&D"})
├── valid_from: 1995-03-01
├── valid_to: 1998-06-30
└── valid_range: [1995-03-01, 1998-06-30)

-- Query: "Who did I work with at Acme in 1996?"
SELECT DISTINCT e.name
FROM relationships r1
JOIN relationships r2 ON r2.target_entity_id = r1.target_entity_id
JOIN entities e ON e.id = r2.source_entity_id
WHERE r1.source_entity_id = :my_id
  AND r1.target_entity_id = :acme_id
  AND r1.valid_range @> '1996-06-01'::timestamptz
  AND r2.valid_range @> '1996-06-01'::timestamptz
  AND r2.relationship_type = 'WORKED_AT';
```

### 6.5 LLM Temporal Interpretation

| Req ID | Requirement | Priority |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| TEMP-LLM-001 | Parse natural language time references ("in the 90s", "when I was at Acme") | High |
| TEMP-LLM-002 | Resolve relative dates ("before Emma was born", "during college") | High |
| TEMP-LLM-003 | Handle ambiguous dates with clarification | Medium |
| TEMP-LLM-004 | Infer time periods from context ("my first job" → earliest employment) | Medium |

#### Natural Language → Temporal Range Examples
```
"in 1996"           → [1996-01-01, 1997-01-01)
"the late 90s"      → [1997-01-01, 2000-01-01)
"when Emma was born" → (lookup Emma's birthdate) → point query
"before 2010"       → (-infinity, 2010-01-01)
"my first job"      → (find earliest WORKED_AT relationship)
```

### 6.6 Temporal Fact Ingestion
